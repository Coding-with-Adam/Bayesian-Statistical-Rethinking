# Bayesian-Statistical-Rethinking

This repository consists of codes and notes that pertain to Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking. All the notebooks belong to Osvaldo Martin and the 12 contributers of the github master: https://github.com/aloctavodia/Statistical-Rethinking-with-Python-and-PyMC3. 


All I did is take the master and added a few of my own notations as well as expanded on code I wasn't clear about.

Thank you to the Pymc3 community that helped support this github, Osvaldo Martin, and Richard McElreath.
